PALINDROMIFY


Palindromify is a simple game that lets you play with a palindrome (回文). 
I have put it up on my Google App Engine here:

For those of you who don’t know what “palindrome” is, it is “a word, line, verse, number, sentence, etc., reading the same backward as forward, e.g. Panda had nap.

For a reference, there’s a great website that has a very long list of palindromes: Neil/Fred's Gigantic List of Palindromes

Rule:
● If what you enter is a palindrome, you get a score which is half the length of the palindrome, rounded up.
● Top 5 highest scores and total scores are listed on “Hall OF Fame.”  
● Non-alphabetical characters are not counted.

Note: 
● Player’s name and scores are kept in memory; nothing is held in a file or a specific database.
● It’s a simple 2-page/file app; there’s no login page to distinguish you from other players, either.
● The app recognizes you as a returning player only if your name already exists in the memory; if you happen to use the same name as another’s which is already in the memory, you won’t get a score. The incumbent player will.
● I created this app because I wanted to actually make something upon finishing my study for OCJP a.k.a. SCJP, Oracle Certified Professional Java SE 6 Programmer, reflecting what I had learned from books and web. It’s a small, over-the-weekend project. Not everything I learned is in it. No fancy, visual effects, either. I might get back to this app in the future for bug-fixing, refactoring, and enhancements.
