PALINDROMIFY


Palindromify is a simple game that lets you play with a palindrome (回文). 
I have put it up on my Google App Engine here: http://magarisugikamo.appspot.com/Palindrome

For those of you who don’t know what “palindrome” is, it is “a word, line, verse, number, sentence, etc., reading the same backward as forward, e.g. Panda had nap.

For a reference, there’s a great website that has a very long list of palindromes: Neil/Fred's Gigantic List of Palindromes

Rule:
● If what you enter is a palindrome, you get a score which is half the length of the palindrome, rounded up.
● Top 5 highest scores and total scores are listed on “Hall OF Fame.”  
● Non-alphabetical characters are not counted.

Note: 
● Player’s name and scores are kept in memory; nothing is held in a file or a specific database.
● It’s a simple 2-page/file app; there’s no login page to distinguish you from other players, either.
● The app recognizes you as a returning player only if your name already exists in the memory; if you happen to use the same name as others’ which are already in the memory, you won’t get a score. The incumbent player will.
● I created this app because I wanted to actually make something upon finishing my study for OCJP a.k.a. SCJP, Oracle Certified Professional Java SE 6 Programmer, reflecting what I had learned from books and web. It’s a small, over-the-weekend project. Not everything I learned is in it. No fancy, visual effects, either. I might get back to this app in the future for bug-fixing, refactoring, and enhancements.
